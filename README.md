# Klipper Adaptive Flow & Crash Guard

**A closed-loop flow control and artifact detection system for Klipper.**

This system uses the TMC driver feedback from your extruder to actively manage temperature, pressure advance, and print speed in real-time. It requires **no external sensors** and **no slicer modifications**.

## ✨ Features

### 1. 🌊 Hydro-Dynamic Temp Boosting
Automatically raises the Hotend Temperature as flow rate increases (Feed-Forward). This compensates for the thermal lag of the heater block during high-speed moves.

### 2. 🛡️ Extrusion Crash Detection
Monitors the extruder motor for sudden resistance spikes (Load Deltas).
*   **Blobs/Tangles/Clogs:** If the nozzle hits a blob or the filament tangles, the resistance spikes.
*   **Automatic Recovery:** If >3 spikes are detected in a single layer, the system automatically slows the print speed to **50%** for the next 3 layers to allow the print to recover, then restores full speed.

### 3. 🧠 Smart Cornering ("Sticky Heat")
Prevents the "Bulging Corner" issue common with other auto-temp scripts.
*   The script heats up fast but cools down *very slowly*.
*   This ensures the plastic remains fluid during the deceleration phase of a corner, preventing internal pressure buildup.

### 4. 📐 Dynamic Pressure Advance
Automatically **lowers** Pressure Advance (PA) as the temperature rises.
*   Hotter plastic is more fluid and requires less PA.
*   This prevents "gaps" or "cutting corners" caused by aggressive PA at high temperatures.

### 5. 👁️ Machine-Side Layer Watcher
Uses a Z-height monitor to detect layer changes automatically. You do not need to add custom G-Code to your Slicer.

This system is tuned and verified specifically for the following hardware ecosystem. While the logic works on any Klipper printer, the **tuning values** provided in this guide assume:

*   **Hotend:** E3D Revo (High Flow or Standard).
*   **Extruder:** Voron StealthBurner (CW2) or Sherpa Mini.
*   **Motor:** NEMA 14 Pancake (LDO-36STH20 or Generic Clones).
*   **Driver:** TMC2209 via UART.
*   **Electronics:** BigTreeTech EBB36 or SB2209 (CAN Bus).

*If you use standard NEMA 17 motors or different drivers, you will need to adjust the `sensor_baseline` and `noise_filter` significantly.*

## 📦 Installation

### Step 1: Install the Python Extension
This script is required to read the TMC register data directly.

a.  Create a file named `extruder_monitor.py` in your extras directory: `~/klipper/klippy/extras/extruder_monitor.py`
    <br/>Copy the extruder_monitor.py

b: Install the Configuration <br/>
Create a file named auto_flow.cfg in your config directory: ~/printer_data/config/auto_flow.cfg
   <br/> Copy auto_flow.cfg
Note: This file contains a USER CONFIGURATION section at the top. You should edit this to match your motor type (see Tuning section).
c: restart klipper <br/>
sudo systemctl restart klipper


### Step 2: Edit printer.cfg
Open your printer.cfg and add the following lines.
```
[include auto_flow.cfg]

[extruder_monitor]
# IMPORTANT: Change this to match your actual driver section!
# Examples: "tmc2209 extruder" or "tmc2209 stepper_e" or "tmc5160 extruder"
driver_name: tmc2209 extruder

[save_variables]
filename: ~/printer_data/config/sfs_auto_flow_vars.cfg
```
 --- Toolhead Temp ---<br/>
 If using EBB36/SB2209, name your temp sensor "Toolhead_Temp" for better accuracy.
```
[temperature_sensor Toolhead_Temp]
sensor_type: temperature_mcu
sensor_mcu: EBBCan
```

In your TMC section of your extruder place the following
```
[tmc2209 extruder]
run_current: 0.650
stealthchop_threshold: 0
driver_SGTHRS: 120
```
### Step 3: If you use PrusaSlicer, SuperSlicer, or OrcaSlicer, put this in your "Machine Start G-code":
   ```
   PRINT_START BED={first_layer_bed_temperature[0]} EXTRUDER={first_layer_temperature[0]} MATERIAL={filament_type[0]}
```
   
### Step 4: Start Macro <br/>
Adapt your PRINT_START from my example. 
<br/>This handles the sensitivity tuning for different materials automatically.



## ⚙️ Configuration & Calibration

All settings are now located at the **top** of the `auto_flow.cfg` file in the `USER CONFIGURATION` block. You do not need to search through the code logic.

### 1. Calibrating Motor Baseline (Required)
The script needs to know the "Baseline Load" of your motor (how it feels when spinning freely).

**Step 1: Setup the Test**
1.  Ensure `max_extrude_only_distance: 101.0` is set in the `[extruder]` section of `printer.cfg`.
2.  Add this temporary macro to your config:
    ```ini
    [gcode_macro AT_CHECK_BASELINE]
    gcode:
        {% set temp = params.TEMP|default(220)|int %}
        M117 Heating...
        M109 S{temp}
        M117 Extruding...
        G91
        G1 E100 F3000
        G90
        GET_EXTRUDER_LOAD
        G4 P500
        GET_EXTRUDER_LOAD
        G4 P500
        GET_EXTRUDER_LOAD
    ```

**Step 2: Run the Test**
1.  Heat your nozzle.
2.  Unload filament (or lift Z high so it extrudes into air).
3.  Run `AT_CHECK_BASELINE`.
4.  Note the **Extruder Load** number printed in the console (e.g., 16, 60, 120).

**Step 3: Update Config**
1.  Open `auto_flow.cfg`.
2.  Edit the `sensor_baseline` variable at the top to match your number.

### 2. Motor Tuning Guidelines

Different motors require different sensitivity settings. Update the variables at the top of `auto_flow.cfg` based on your hardware.

#### Option A: LDO Pancake / Orbiter / Sherpa / Generic Clones
*These motors have low inductance and often report very low sensor values (0-20).*

*   **Settings (`auto_flow.cfg`):**
    *   `sensor_baseline`: **~16** (Match your test result).
    *   `noise_filter`: **2** (Must be low to detect small signals).
    *   `crash_threshold`: **10** (Higher sensitivity for small jolts).
*   **Start Macro (`PRINT_START`):**
    *   Use **High K-Values** (Load K: 0.6 - 0.8) to compensate for the weak signal.

#### Option B: Standard NEMA 17 (Clockwork 1, Bowden, etc)
*These motors usually provide high resolution readings (60-120).*

*   **Settings (`auto_flow.cfg`):**
    *   `sensor_baseline`: **~60 - 100** (Match your test result).
    *   `noise_filter`: **10** (Filters out vibration noise).
    *   `crash_threshold`: **20** (Standard sensitivity).
*   **Start Macro (`PRINT_START`):**
    *   Use **Standard K-Values** (Load K: 0.1 - 0.2).

### 3. Troubleshooting Low Values
If your `AT_CHECK_BASELINE` returns extremely low numbers (0-10) even when spinning freely, the driver is struggling to detect the load.

1.  **Install Klipper TMC Autotune:** This optimizes the driver timings for your specific motor.
    *   Run via SSH: `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andrewmcgr/klipper_tmc_autotune/main/install.sh && bash install.sh`
    *   Add `[autotune_tmc extruder]` to `printer.cfg`.
    *   Restart Klipper.

2.  **Verify & Accept:** Run the baseline test again.
    *   If the number jumps up (e.g. to 60+), great. Use that.
    *   **Note:** Many generic/clone NEMA 14 motors will **always** read low (e.g., 12-16) even with Autotune. **This is normal.** Just set your `sensor_baseline` to 16 and your `noise_filter` to 2. The script works fine with low numbers as long as they are stable.

## 📊 Hardware Limits & Benchmarks

The Adaptive Flow script works by demanding **extra heat** during fast moves. However, it cannot create energy that your hardware is unable to supply. If your heater hits 100% duty cycle, the temperature will drop regardless of what the script commands.

### Case Study: E3D Revo High Flow (40W)
*   **Setup:** Revo HF 0.4mm Nozzle + **40W** HeaterCore.
*   **Material:** PETG.
*   **Script Settings:** Standard Auto-Flow defaults.
*   **Result:** Flow remains stable up to **~26 mm³/s**.
*   **The Ceiling:** Above 26 mm³/s, the 40W heater saturates (hits 100% power). It physically cannot generate enough heat to maintain the temperature, let alone boost it.

**Conclusion:**
To push reliably past **30 mm³/s** while using this script, a **60W HeaterCore** is required. The 60W core provides the necessary "headroom" for the script to apply Turbo/Boost commands during high-speed maneuvers without bottoming out the temperature.
